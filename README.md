Trouble with FreeCAD + Assembly3 memory usage

Open step_export/dexter_onshape_step_exported.fcstd to see memory usage of [Dexter1's onshape model](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/2af8ed0e61a34ebf69284c68/w/72caf65e51bde98e456925d2/e/6843c182cbf9181dbb307455) exported in STEP format, and imported into FreeCAD.

Open assembly3/Dexter1-KickstarterUpdated.fcstd to see memory usage of the above put into [Assembly3](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=20&t=34583) containers in order to use constraints.
